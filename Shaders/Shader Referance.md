# Shader Descriptions
1. CubeSurfaceShader_Diff_Texture_Each_Face
   - Create a material and add this shader to it and then in the material properties you can add a texture to the specific face. You can also add a border to 4 of the faces. My intention for this was to rotate the cube and have all the faces be a different texture and not to show the top and bottom. For one face the texture was rotated so that it displayed correctly when the face was showing.
